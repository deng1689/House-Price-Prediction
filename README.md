IntroductionÂ¶
This notebook is going to be focused on solving the problem of predicting house prices for house buyers and house sellers.

A house value is simply more than location and square footage. Like the features that make up a person, an educated party would want to know all aspects that give a house its value.

We are going to take advantage of all of the feature variables available to use and use it to analyze and predict house prices.

We are going to break everything into logical steps that allow us to ensure the cleanest, most realistic data for our model to make accurate predictions from.
